This repository documents the complete process of migrating a VMware virtual machine (VM) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The migration involved exporting the VM from VMware as an OVA file, uploading it to Google Cloud, converting it to a format compatible with GCP, and launching the VM as an instance in the cloud.

The migration provides an alternative to directly creating VMs in GCP by leveraging existing infrastructure and applications.
